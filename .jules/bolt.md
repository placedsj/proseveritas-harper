## 2025-02-12 - App Component Size
**Learning:** `App.tsx` imported all route components statically, causing the entire application to be bundled into the initial load.
**Action:** Implemented `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for all non-critical routes. Default exports work out of the box, but named exports like `MedicalRecords` require `.then(module => ({ default: module.NamedExport }))`.
